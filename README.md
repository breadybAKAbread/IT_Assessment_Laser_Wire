# IT_Assessment_Laser_Wire

For the IOT assignment, I have created a laser tripwire that triggers when walked through.

there are several key components that make the circuit work such as the photoresistor which takes in the 
light from the laser, the Mentos wrapper around the resistor is used to block out any exterior light that may trigger it
so the buzzer won't permanently make noise.

The laser tripwire works best when mounted on a door or doorframe, when someone walks into the laser the photoresistor will pick up no light
thus causing a buzzer to make a sound. I also attempted to make an application that would show if the laser was triggered 
on a website but that was outside my field of skill. 

The laser tripwire can be used to detect intruders in your home and alert you when they walk through it due to the buzzer making a sound
therefore alerting you that they have entered your home. To set up the laser tripwire more than one power source is needed, this is due 
to the laser having to be far away from the photoresistor so it is more likely for someone to walk through it. A good separate power 
source would be a portable charger because they can easily be carried and they're light.
